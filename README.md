# MegaUploader

Simple example of a file upload service built in Go. The objective is to build the
server just using Go's stdlib.

## Planned features

- Sane defaults
- Streaming architecture (don't exhaust memory)
- Pluggable backend storage engine
- Pluggable authorization engine
- Pluggable metadata storage engine
